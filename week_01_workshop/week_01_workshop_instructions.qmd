This guide walks you through the steps to set up your AI‚ÄëCourse Portfolio Website for the Generative AI for Work & Research course.

**NOTE:** This document is a short summary of the steps. For clearer instructions, consult the corresponding video on the website. 

## Open ChatGPT & switch to `o3`
- Go to [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com).
- Click the `‚ñº Model` dropdown at the top left of the chat window.
- Select **OpenAI o3**.

## Paste the prompt & course text 
- Copy any relevant parts of the course description from [thegraphcourses.org/aiw](https://thegraphcourses.org/aiw).
- Start a new message and create an instruction similar to this:
  ```
  Build a one‚Äëpage portfolio website for my "Generative AI for Work & Research" course.
  Use the course information below and my CV.
  At least these three sections:
  - About me
  - About the course
  - My weekly submissions (here we will add links to each submission later on)
  Show the HTML in a Canvas.
  Avoid frameworks.
  Don't include my email in the site to avoid spam
