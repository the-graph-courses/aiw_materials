# Overview

In this session you will try two small but practical GenAI design workflows:

1.  **Create a promotional flyer** for our course showcase using **Ideogram** for image generation and **Canva** for final editing. (You're encouraged to embed this on your website, and share this flyer with colleagues and friends to get them to come to the showcase.)

2.  **Turn a research paper into a visual abstract** using **Claude** and **HTML** or **SVG**.

# Task 1 – AI Flyer for the Final Presentation

**Account Required**: You'll need a free **Ideogram.ai** account. Sign up at **ideogram.ai** if you haven't already.

### 1-A Generate the first draft in Ideogram

1.  Go to **ideogram.ai** and log in to your account. (We're using ideogram instead of ChatGPT's image generation feature because the free image generation on ChatGPT is quite slow and unreliable.)

2.  In the prompt box, describe the image you want to create. Copy and paste the following recommended prompt, making sure to replace `[YOUR WEBSITE NAME HERE]` with your actual website name:

```         
Create an elegant modern flyer for the following event:
► Main headline: "Graph Courses – AI Portfolio Showcase Day".
► Sub-headline: "Generative AI for Work & Research".
► Date and Time
   • Friday, 27 Jun 2025  3 – 5 PM (GMT)
   • Sunday, 29 Jun 2025  5 – 7 PM (GMT)
► Sign up instructions: "To sign up, visit my website [YOUR WEBSITE NAME HERE] and open the chat bubble. Tell the AI agent you would like to attend the showcase. It will collect your details and we'll send you a confirmation email."
```

3.  Click **Generate**. Ideogram will create 4 different variations of your flyer. Choose the one you like best and click **Download**.

### 1-B Fix typography in Canva

**Account Required**: You'll need a **Canva.com** account with pro features. Sign up and start a free trial at **canva.com**. **Important**: Cancel the trial within your account settings immediately after completing the signup process to avoid charges. (If you have already used up your free trial, please create a new account with a different email address. If this is not possible, please contact an instructor for help.)

AI-generated text in the images from Ideogram are likely to be error-ridden. To fix this, we can use Canva's Grab Text feature to make the text editable and fix the errors.

1.  Go to **canva.com** and log in to your account.
2.  Drag-and-drop your downloaded Ideogram image into the Canva interface
3.  Once the image is uploaded, click on it to select it, then click "Create design" at the top right of the screen.

4.  With the image still selected, click the top left "edit" button.

Then click on Grab Text under Magic Studio. You may need to scroll right to see it.

5.  Use the text tool to correct any typos, change fonts, and adjust colors as needed.

### 1-C Share & Upload

1.  Click on "Share" at the top right of the Canva page.
2.  Click on "Download", change the file type to "PDF Standard" and click "Download".
3.  Upload the PDF to your assignment submission area on the course page.

# Task 2 – AI Visual Abstracts

**Account Required**: You'll need a free **Claude.ai** account. Sign up at **claude.ai** if you haven't already.

In this section, we'll use AI and design tools to turn a research paper into a visual abstract. A visual abstract is a pictorial representation of the main findings of a research paper, and is a great way to communicate the key results of a paper in an appealing visual format.

### 2-A Choose Your Paper

Pick any recent research paper you are interested in. Make sure you have access to both the paper title and abstract text, as you'll need to copy and paste these into Claude in the next step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2-B Generate Visual Abstract with Claude

Go to **claude.ai** and log in to your account. Use Claude to create either an SVG or HTML-based "visual abstract" of your chosen paper.

(We recommend Claude over ChatGPT for this task because 
- a) it tends to be better at design tasks, and 
- b) it gives you an easy way to download SVG code.

Choose one of the following two approaches (SVG or HTML) and give Claude the corresponding prompt. Feel free to try both approaches and compare the results.

**Option 1: SVG Visual Abstract**
```         
Create an SVG code-based visual abstract of the following paper:

[Paper Title]
[Paper Abstract]
```

**Option 2: HTML Visual Abstract**

```         
Create an HTML visual abstract of the following paper:

[Paper Title]
[Paper Abstract]
```

After Claude generates the initial design, you can ask it to make specific changes or improvements to refine the visual abstract.

### 2-C Edit and Finalize

**If you chose SVG:**

1.  In Claude, click on the dropdown arrow at the top right of the SVG preview
2.  Click on "Download SVG"

![Download SVG in Claude](images/download_svg.jpg)

3.  Open PowerPoint and drag the downloaded SVG file into a slide
4.  To make the elements editable, you need to ungroup/convert the SVG: 
   - **For Mac users**: Right-click on the image, click on "Group", then "Ungroup". You may need to repeat this process several times until there's nothing left to ungroup.

   - **For Windows users**: Right-click on the image and click on "Convert to shape".

5.  Now you can make any edits you need to individual elements
6.  When finished, export as a PDF or take a screenshot of your slide

**If you chose HTML:**

1.  Copy the HTML code from Claude's response
2.  Go to **grapesjs.com** (a free visual HTML editor) and open the editor
3.  Paste the HTML code into the editor
4.  Use the visual interface to edit the design as needed
5.  For detailed guidance on editing with GrapesJS, watch this video:

6. When you're satisfied with your design, take a screenshot of the final result.

### 2-D Submit Your Work

Upload your final visual abstract (PDF, screenshot, or exported file) to your assignment submission area on the course page. The page should allow multiple submissions. (After you upload one file, simply repeat the process to upload another file.)
