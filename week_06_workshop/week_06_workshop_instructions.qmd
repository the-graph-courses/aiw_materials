# Overview

In this session you will try two small but practical GenAI design workflows:

1.  **Create a promotional flyer** for our course showcase using **Ideogram** for image generation and **Canva** for final editing.
2.  (**Optional challenge**) **Turn a research paper into a visual abstract** using **Claude** and **HTML** or **SVG**.

# Task 1 – AI Flyer for the Final Presentation

### 1-A Generate the first draft in Ideogram

1.  Sign up for a free account on **ideogram.ai**.
2.  In the prompt box, describe the image you want to create. Here is the proposed prompt.

<details>

<summary><strong>Short Ideogram prompt (\~900 chars)</strong></summary>

```         
Create an attractive flyer for the following event:
► Main headline: “Graph Courses – Generative AI Portfolio Showcase”.
► Sub-headline: “Final class presentation”.
► Date and Time
   • Friday, 27 Jun 2025  3 – 5 PM (GMT)
   • Sunday, 29 Jun 2025  5 – 7 PM (GMT)
► Sign up instructions: “Sign up on my website [WEBSITE NAME HERE] open the chat bubble and tell the agent you would like to attend the showcase.”
```

</details>

4.  Click **Generate**. Pick the best variation and press **Download** (JPG or PNG).

### 1-B Fix typography in Canva

Typically, the text will be error-ridden. To fix this, we can use Canva's Grab Text feature.

1.  Go to **canva.com** Sign up and start a free trial for the pro features. Cancel the trial immediately after.
2.  Drag-and-drop your Ideogram image onto the blank page.
3.  Once uploaded, click it and right click "Create design" at the top right.
4.  Select the image, click to edit it, then in the left sidebar click **Magic Studio → Grab Text**. *Canva auto-extracts the pixel text into editable layers.*

### 1-C Share & Upload

1.  Click on "Share" at the top right of the Canva page.
2.  Click on "Download", change file type to "PDF Standard" and click "Download".
3.  Upload the PDF to the course page.

# Optional Challenge – AI Visual Abstracts

### 2-A Choose Your Paper

Pick any recent research paper you are interested in. You'll need the paper title and abstract for the next step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2-B Generate Visual Abstract with Claude

Use Claude to create either an SVG or HTML-based "visual abstract" of the paper.

**Option 1: SVG Visual Abstract**

```         
Create an SVG visual abstract of the following paper:

[Paper Title]
[Paper Abstract]
```

**Option 2: HTML Visual Abstract**

```         
Create an HTML visual abstract of the following paper:

[Paper Title]
[Paper Abstract]
```

After the initial prompt, you can iterate on the output to refine the design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2-C Edit and Finalize (Choose Your Path)

**If you chose SVG:**

1.  Click on the dropdown at the top right of the SVG in Claude
2.  Click on "Download SVG"
3.  Drag the SVG to PowerPoint
4.  Right click on the image, click on Group, then Ungroup. You may need to do this a few times, until there is nothing left to ungroup.
5.  Make any edits you need
6.  Export as a PDF or take a screenshot

**If you chose HTML:**

1.  Copy the HTML code from Claude
2.  Open GrapesJS (a GUI editor) and paste the code
3.  Edit the design as needed using the visual interface
4.  Review the following video guide for details on how to edit with GrapesJS:
