# Introduction

In this workshop, you'll create an automated workflow using Make.com that processes consultation inquiries submitted through a Google Form. The automation will:

1.  Monitor a Google Form for new submissions
2.  Use an AI model to research the potential client's company and generate a report
3.  Create a formatted Google Doc with the research findings
4.  Send you an email notification with the report

The goal here is to build an extremely simple automation that demonstrates the power of connecting different web services with an AI Large Language Model (LLM). Setting up this automation is quite a bit of work, but the beauty of automations of course is that (in theory) you should only need to set it up once!

In the wild, you will find much more complex automations. Many organizations run a large fraction of their processes using automations on services like Make.com. With the rise of LLMs, these automations can do increasingly complex tasks.

# Part 1: Setting Up Your Google Form and Data Collection

## Create Your Project Folder

1.  In your browser, navigate to [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/)
2.  Click **New** at the top left → then click **New folder**
3.  Name the folder something like `GenAI Consultations`
4.  Double-click to open the folder

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/6e163120-758c-4186-b7f3-be06417a2cd6/File.jpeg?tl_px=0,0&br_px=1376,769&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=0.7&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/FB923C_standard.png&wat_pad=337,171){width="619"}

## Build Your Consultation Form

1.  Inside the folder, again click **New** then click on **Google Forms** to create a new form.

2.  In the title field enter: `Consultation Inquiry`

3.  Set up the following form questions:

    -   **Question 1:** "Name" (Short answer)
    -   **Question 2:** "Email" (Short answer)
    -   **Question 3:** "What is your company name and primary geographic area?" (Short answer)
    -   **Question 4:** "What would you like help with?" (Paragraph)

![](images/consultation_form.jpg){width="525"}

4.  When done, click **Publish** at the top right to make your form live.

## Test Your Form and Connect to Sheets

1.  Click the Share button at the top right, then copy the responder link.

2.  Open the form in a new tab and submit a test response. For example

    -   Name: `John Doe`
    -   Email: `john.doe@example.com`
    -   Company: `The Graduate Institute, Geneva`
    -   Help needed: `General advice on how to use GenAI to help students`

3.  Return to the form editor tab and click **Responses**. This will show you the responses to your form. You should see a new response in the list.

4.  Click **Link to Sheets** → **Create** to generate a connected spreadsheet.

5.  Share the spreadsheet by clicking **Share** in the top right → **Copy link**. Copy this link to your clipboard. We will use it in the next section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2: Setting Up Make.com Automation

## Build Your First Module: Google Sheets Watcher

1.  If you have not yet done so, create a Make.com account. Once done, navigate to <https://www.make.com/en> and sign in.

2.  Click **Create a new scenario**

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/2a6e92d6-c1a2-4737-93dd-ae062ef61780/File.jpeg?tl_px=148,0&br_px=1525,769&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=0.7&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/FB923C_standard.png&wat_pad=962,5){width="455"}

3.  Click the plus button to add a new module, and select **Google Sheets**

![](images/scenario_new_row.jpg){width="356"}

4.  Choose **Watch New Rows ACID**. This will watch for new rows in the spreadsheet, and trigger when someone fills out the connected form.

5.  Click **Creating a connection...** → **Sign in with Google**

6.  You may need to select your Google account and authorize access. Give all requested permissions. (Note that you it is only *your* automations that have the access, not the entire Make.com service, so you do not need to worry about data security or leakage.)

7.  Now, configure the module settings:

    -   **Spreadsheet ID:** Navigate to and select your consultation form spreadsheet. It should be called something like Consultation Inquiry.
    -   **Sheet name:** Select "Form Responses 1"
    -   **Limit:** Set to `1` (processes one response at a time)
    -   Click **Save**

![](images/sheets_boxes.jpg){width="26%"}

### Test the Workflow

Now to test the connection, you need to perform the steps below.

1.  Right-click on the Google Sheets module
2.  Click **"Choose where to start"**
3.  Click **"All"** → **"Save"**
4.  Click **"Run once"** at the bottom left

![](images/choose_where_to_start.jpg){width="200"} ![](images/test_all.jpg){width="291"} ![](images/run_once.jpg){width="288"}

Note that you will need to do this every time you want to test your workflow.

If you get no errors, the workflow is working properly.

### Save your work

Make does not save your work automatically. You need to click the **Save** icon at the bottom after major changes so that in case you refresh the page or lose connection, you do not lose your work.

![](images/save_button.jpg){width="389"}

# Part 3: Adding AI Research Capabilities

## Set Up OpenRouter AI Module

1.  Click the **+** button next to the Google Sheets module

2.  Search for **OpenRouter** and select **Create a chat completion**

![](images/openrouter_select.jpg){width="389"}

3.  Click **Create a connection** and enter the openrouter API key that was emailed to you some time ago.

## Configure the AI Research Prompt

1.  Under **Messages**, click **Add item**

<!-- -->

2.  In the **Content** field, paste a prompt that looks something like:

```         
A potential client has filled out a form on my website requesting generative AI consulting services. Research the company/organization below and create a clear, elegant markdown report that covers an introduction to the business as well as potential generative AI opportunities for their work.

Use emojis, tables, and lists for visual appeal while keeping your writing clear and concise.

If you cannot find online information about the company, just indicate so.

Do not include any prelude or postlude.

Company Name and Geography:
```

3.  After the prompt, click the variable selector and choose the company name field from your Google Form (e.g., "What is your company name...")

So each time someone fills out the form, the company name will be added to the prompt, and send to the AI model.

<!-- -->

4.  Set the **Role** field to **User**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/b4b2b521-eb1d-4524-9efc-3f870e43364e/File.jpeg?tl_px=148,182&br_px=1525,952&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=0.7&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/FB923C_standard.png&wat_pad=833,329)

5.  In the **Model** field, type "search" and select **OpenAI: GPT-4o Search Preview**
    -   This model can search the internet to research companies, providing more comprehensive and current information. In the past we used Perplexity Sonar for this, but our testing shows that OpenAI's model works a bit better for this task.

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/6e4b7179-b274-404a-afda-c350d6e7f45d/File.jpeg?tl_px=148,182&br_px=1525,952&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=0.7&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/FB923C_standard.png&wat_pad=869,298)

6.  Click **Save**

### Test and Save Your Workflow

Now that you have two modules, you should test the workflow again!

1.  As you did before, right-click the Google Sheets module → **Choose where to start** → **All** → **Save**
2.  Then click **Run once** at the bottom left to test the entire workflow
3.  If you get no errors, then all is working fine.
4.  Click the Save icon in the bottom toolbar to save your work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 4: Converting to HTML

By default, OpenAI's Search model outputs a format of content called "markdown". But Google Docs prefers the HTML format, so we can use a built-in Make.com module to convert from markdown to HTML.

## Add Markdown to HTML Converter

1.  Click the **+** button next to the OpenRouter module
2.  Search for **Markdown** and select **Markdown to HTML**
3.  In the **Markdown** field, select the AI response from the variable picker:
    -   Navigate to OpenRouter variables → **Choices** → **Message** → **Content** and click on **Content**. 
4.  Set **Sanitize** to **Yes**
5.  Click **Save**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/72c82764-67e3-45fc-ae0c-3811cbf6b9c1/File.webp)

### Test And Save the Workflow

Again, follow the sequence to test your flow:

Right-click the first module → **Choose where to start** → **All** → **Save** → **Run once** (You may see a warning about running with transformation as the last node - click **Run anyway**)

Save your work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 5: Creating Google Docs Reports

## Set Up Google Docs Module

1.  Click the **+** button to add another module
2.  Search for **Google Docs** and select **Create a document**

![](images/create_docs_module.jpg){width="425"}

3.  For the document **Name**, type: `GenAI Web Report for` then select the company name variable from your form
4.  For the **Content** field, we want to add the HTML output from the Markdown converter. However, for Google Docs to recognize the content as HTML, we need to wrap the HTML in a `<html>` tag. So:
    -   Type: `<html>`
    -   Add the **HTML** variable from the Markdown converter
    -   Type: `</html>`
5.  Under **New document's location folder**, search for and select your "GenAI Consultations" folder
6.  Click **Save**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/9d1ef82c-ade1-4ef0-bc62-9ce9c621b994/File.webp)

### Test and Save Workflow

Run your complete workflow test again and save your work. If successful, check your Google Drive for the newly created report document. If you're unhappy with the report, try editing the prompt and rerunning your test until you get an output that works.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 6: Adding Email Notifications

## Set Up Resend Email Service

Sending emails from your automations is often useful. In an ideal case, you can connect your own email directly to the make.com service and draft and send emails from your account using your automations.

But connecting personal Gmail accounts to Make.com requires a somewhat long setup process (see: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlDT_D9zjnU>) and connecting company email accounts typically requires special permissions.

To simplify our demonstration, we'll instead use a service called Resend.com (email service for app development) for easy email delivery:

1.  Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and create a free account.
2.  On the homepage or API Keys page, create an API key and copy it.

## Configure Email Module in Make.com

1.  Add a new module and search for **Resend**
2.  Select **Send an Email**

![](images/resend_email.jpg){width="246"}

3.  Click **Creating a connection...** and paste your Resend API key
4.  Click **Save**
5.  Configure the email settings:
    -   **From:** `onboarding@resend.dev`
    -   **Subject:** Type `GenAI Report for` then add the company name variable
    -   **To:** Enter your email address
    -   **Send email as:** Select **HTML**
    -   **HTML content:** Add the HTML variable from the Markdown converter
6.  Click **Save**

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/50ba9064-1f0e-4cc3-a1ad-e85bdb124e98/File.webp)

### Test Email Delivery

Run your complete workflow test. You should receive an email with the generated report. Save your work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 7: Activating Your Automation

Congratulations! You've now built a complete automation that will process new form submissions automatically! Let's make it live.

## Set Schedule and Activate

1.  Locate the scheduling section next to the **Run once** button
2.  We recommend changing the frequency from **Minutes** to **120** (runs every 2 hours)
    -   This prevents using too many operations on the free plan (1000 credits limit)
3.  Click **Save**
4.  Toggle the scenario **On** or click **Activate scenario** if prompted

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/56d2a9c3-6c0f-4f84-9fbf-6340c3df89c7/File.webp)

Your automation is now live and will process new form submissions automatically!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 8: Embedding the Form in Your Website

## Get the Embed Code

1.  Return to your Google Form
2.  Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top right
3.  Select **Embed**
4.  Copy the provided HTML embed code

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/390e2496-d4ca-4073-a977-ff9a638f18ff/File.webp)

## Add to Your Portfolio Website

1.  Go to ChatGPT or your favorite LLM and open your existing portfolio conversation, or copy paste in the index.html code from your page.
2.  Provide a prompt that looks something like this:

```         
Please update my portfolio website to include this consultation form. 
Add a new section called "Contact for Consultation" and embed this Google Form:

[Paste your embed code here]
```

3.  Update your GitHub Pages website with ChatGPT's new HTML code
4.  Commit/Push the changes to make your consultation form live

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Submission

To submit your work:

1.  Export and upload your scenario blueprint. In the bottom toolbar, under the more options, click **Export Blueprint**. This contains a file that represents your completed workflow. (This means if you wanted you could share, \[or sell!\] your workflows!)
2.  Upload that file to the submission form.
