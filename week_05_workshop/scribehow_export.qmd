24\. Click into the content field of the first item, and paste in a prompt that looks like the following: \
\
"A potential client has filled out a form on my website requesting generative AI consulting services. Research the company/organization below and create a clear, elegant markdown report that covers their business and potential generative AI opportunities for their work.

Use emojis, tables, and lists for visual appeal while keeping your writing clear and concise.

Do not include any prelude or postlude.

Company Name and Geography:"\
\
After that prompt, click into the side panel that you see that lets you access variables from past steps, Click the variable that represents the country from the form. Something like "What is your compnay name..."

26\. Select "User" as the role (This just means we are acting as a user of the AI model)

28\. Type the term "search"


29\. Click "OpenAI: GPT-4o Search Preview". Unlike most models accessible through openrouter, this model can directly use the internet to search for things. So it will use a search engine to try to find info about the company and select and summarize the best results. In the past we have used perplexity sonar for this, but openai's model gives slightly better outputs for this task.

39\. Click the button again to make new module, search for docs, and select create a new document under google docs


40\. For the Name, you can call it somethign like GenAI Web Report for then select the google forms response from your variable selector.

But we need to wrap the variable in opening and closing html tag\
\
Type "&lt;&gt; [[left]] html [[right]] [[enter]]"\
Click the "HTML" variable from the markdown converter thing\

44\. Double-click "GenAI Web Report forThe Graph Courses (Global)"

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-06-06/cff6c60e-1f5d-4677-93d8-484e09a432d7/File.jpeg?tl_px=0,0&br_px=1376,769&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=0.7&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/FB923C_standard.png&wat_pad=370,247)


45\. Now we have the report. we also want the automation to send us an email. \
\
normally you can just connect your email with make to send emails from your own email, but with personal gmail accounts the setup is quite time-consuming (see here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlDT_D9zjnU>), so we are using the [resend.com](https://resend.com) service as a temporary easy way to send emails from [make.com](https://make.com)\
\
Go to resend.com, sign up for an account. On the homepage, there should be button to click to create an api key. create and copy it.


46\. Go back to [make.com](https://make.com) \
CLick to create a new module, then search for resend, click it \
Click the "Send an Email" option for esent\
Click "Creating a connection..."\
Click the "API Key\*" field and enter your copied key\
Click "Save"


47\. In the from field for this module, type "onboarding@resend.dev"


48\. In the subject field,\
Type "GenAI Report for " then click the variable about "What is your company name and primary country" from the google form


49\. In the to field, type your email (the one you signed up for resend with) "[kendavidn2@gmail.com](mailto:kendavidn2@gmail.com)"\
Click "Item 1"\
Under the send email as field\
Click "HTML"\

50\. Again test....If all is well you should receive an email. \
\
we now want to activate our scenario.


51\. Beside the run once button there is a section that shows how frequently the scenario runs, and a dial for on off.\
Double-click the "Minutes\*" field.\
Change to "120" minutes. This means it will only run once every two hours. That way you don't use up too many operations. (The free plan for make only gives you 1000 credits) \
Click "Save"\
Click "Activate scenario" if you get the popup. or turn the dial on.
