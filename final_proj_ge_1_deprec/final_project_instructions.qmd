# Overview

The final project is your opportunity to apply the skills you've learned in this course to a real-world problem or opportunity in your own work or research area. You will select one of the topics covered during the course, enhance it, and present your work in a short presentation.

The goal is to create a practical AI-powered solution that demonstrates your ability to automate tasks, generate content, or manage knowledge more effectively.

# Project Requirements

1.  **Choose a Core Topic**: Select one of the six main topics from the course to build upon.
2.  **Enhance and Customize**: Go beyond the workshop exercises. Adapt the tools and workflows to a specific use case relevant to your professional or academic context.
3.  **Create a Presentation**: Prepare a 4-minute presentation (e.g., a slide deck) that explains your project.
4.  **Submit Your Work**: Submit your slide deck for review.

# Project Options

You can base your project on any of the following weekly modules. You are also welcome to combine elements from one or two modules.

*   **Week 1: Enhanced Content & Web Presence**
    *   Create a professional website or a series of documents for a project, course, or lab group. Use GenAI for content generation and structuring the site/documents with a tool like Quarto or Carrd.

*   **Week 2: Automated Data Analytics Product**
    *   Develop an automated data processing and visualization workflow for a dataset from your field. Use tools like Julius, ChatGPT Code Interpreter, or TheBricks to create a dashboard or report that provides actionable insights.

*   **Week 3: AI-Powered Research Assistant**
    *   Build a system for conducting a literature review or text analysis on a body of research. Use tools like Elicit or LiteRev in a loop with an LLM to synthesize findings, classify documents, or extract key information.

*   **Week 4: Custom Chatbot/Agent**
    *   Design and build a custom chatbot to support a specific task, such as answering questions about a research paper, guiding a user through a protocol, or managing a project. Use a platform like Botpress to create the agent.

*   **Week 5: Advanced Workflow Automation**
    *   Identify a repetitive, multi-step process in your work and automate it. Use a tool like Make.com to connect different applications (e.g., Google Sheets, Gmail, a database) and orchestrate a seamless workflow.

*   **Week 6: Professional Design & Communication**
    *   Create a suite of professional communication materials (e.g., flyer, social media posts, visual abstract) for an event, project, or publication. Use tools like Ideogram, Canva, and Claude for generating images and layouts.

# Evaluation Rubric
