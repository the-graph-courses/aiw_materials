- **0-7**: No evidence of creative thinking or innovation

## 5. Portfolio Integration & Documentation (20 points)

### What to Look For:
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean, well-organized portfolio integration
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear descriptions of process and outcomes
- **User Experience**: Easy to navigate and understand
- **Completeness**: All required elements present and accessible
- **Value Communication**: Clear explanation of project benefits

### Red Flags:
- Broken links or non-functional portfolio elements
- Poor or missing documentation
- Unprofessional presentation of work
- Difficult to access or understand project components
- Missing required portfolio elements

### Scoring Guidelines:
- **18-20**: Seamless professional integration with comprehensive documentation
- **14-17**: Good portfolio integration with adequate documentation
